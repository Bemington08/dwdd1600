        <h1>Gameplay</h1>
        <h2>Core gameplay mechanics</h2>
        <dl>
        <dt>Controls</dt>
        <dd>Subnautica uses the traditional method of moving in video games which is WASD to move forward, left, backward, and right. You use the same controls to swim underwater with the addition of C to descend in the water and the Space Bar to ascend. There is also a toggleable forward movement button which is V. You can also use Shift to sprint on land.</dd>

        <dt>Outcrops</dt>
        <dd>In Subnautica, you collect resources in many different ways. The materials that you use the most are metals that can be found from nodes that spawn on the terrain called outcrops. The most common outcrops are limestone, sandstone, shale, and barnacles that can be found on Reefback leviathons. The materials that are used most in Subnautica are titanium, copper, quartz, gold, silver, lithium, and lead. There are many other materials, but these will make up 90% of what you will use throughout your playthrough.</dd>
        
        <dt>Plants</dt>
        <dd>There is a huge array of plants both under water and on land that you can collect. These range from functional to edible to purely decorative. The plants that you will collect the most throughout your playthrough consists of creepvine, acid mushrooms, deep shrooms, table coral, gel sacks, and many more. There are also edible plants which can mostly be found on the islands. </dd>
        
        <dt>Vehichles</dt>
        <dd>There are three vehichles that you will encounter in Subnautica. These are the Seamoth, P.R.A.W.N Suit, and the Cyclops. There is also a fourth vehichle which is the space ship that you use to escape the planet, but it is not pilotable except to trigger the cutseen that ends the game. All vehichles are spawned by the mobile vehicle bay. This is a small stand that floats ontop of the water with four drones that build the selected vehichle in the air and drops it into the water once it is completely fabricated. The Seamoth is a quick and compact vehicle that you can aquire very early in your playthough. It starts out with a crush depth of 200 meters which can be upgraded later in the game with rare resources. The Seamoth and P.R.A.W.N Suit have four upgrade slots and the Cyclops has six. The P.R.A.W.N Suit is a mechanized suit that allowes the pilot to opperate underwater and even in space. Finally, there is the Cyclops. The Cyclops is a large submarine that you will spend most of your playthough in while exploring. It has a vehichle docking bay where you can put the Seamoth or P.R.A.W.N Suit. It will charge their batteries and can even repair them with the right upgrade.</dd>

        <dt>Base Building</dt>
        <dd>The base building in Subnautica uses a snap on modular system. There are cylindrical rooms which are the main living compartments. There are also large rooms which are about three times the size of the normal rooms. There are also compartments that can be used to connect rooms. These are the I, L, T, and + compartments. These look like the respective letter that they are named after. There are also glass versions of the I and L compartments so that you can get a better view of the ocean. There are many base building pieces that you can put inside your house which can be discovered and scanned all around the world.</dd>

        <dt>Wrecks</dt>
        <dd>There are many pieces of the Aurora that can be found in the various biomes in Subnautica. These wrecks can be very useful as long as you have the right tools to access them. These will allow you to scan tools, decorations, vechicle fragments, abandoned PDAs from the other passengers, and data downloads which will unlock new upgrades for your equipment and new base pieces.</dd>
